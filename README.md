# PCB
The pcb should be reversable. T

# Case
The case is designed out of two parts, the top half and the bottom half. The top half goes between the switches and the pcb, it also goes over the edge of the pcb, hangs over it. The bottom of the case is super slim and shows the hotswap sockets, like TOTEM.
There are two head inserts, for a m3 screw that hold together the top and the bttom of the case.
